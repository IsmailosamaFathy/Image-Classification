## Overview
This project leverages PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework, to develop and evaluate an image classification model for detecting Priority and Stop signs. The project is structured to ensure efficient data handling, model training, and evaluation using standard machine learning practices.
## Implementation Details

# Requirements
Python 3.x
PyTorch
torchvision
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
wandb (optional, used for experiment tracking)

# Data Preparation
Data Organization: Original image data in the total directory is split into training, validation, and testing sets for both Priority and Stop signs. This ensures a balanced distribution for model training and evaluation.

Data Augmentation: Images are resized to 32x32 pixels and normalized to enhance model training efficiency and convergence. This preprocessing step is crucial for handling variations in image quality and ensuring consistent input to the model.

# Model Architecture
Transfer Learning: The project utilizes a pre-trained ResNet-18 model from torchvision and modifies its final fully connected layer to match the number of classes (2 in this case: Priority and Stop). Transfer learning allows leveraging of features learned on a large dataset (ImageNet) to improve the model's performance on the target task with limited training data.

Training Process: The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with momentum and cross-entropy loss function. Training involves iterating over batches of images, computing gradients, and updating model parameters to minimize the loss.

# Model Evaluation
Validation: Throughout training, the model's performance is monitored using a validation set. Validation metrics such as loss and accuracy are computed to assess the model's generalization capability and prevent overfitting.

Testing: After training, the model is evaluated on a separate testing set to measure its accuracy in classifying unseen images. The evaluation includes computing metrics like accuracy score and generating a confusion matrix to analyze the model's predictions.

# Scientific Significance
Real-world Application: Image classification of traffic signs (Priority and Stop) is critical in autonomous driving and traffic management systems. Accurate classification helps in making timely decisions, ensuring safety, and optimizing traffic flow.

Use of Deep Learning: Deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like ResNet-18, excel in image recognition tasks due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from raw data. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in real-world applications.

Scalability and Efficiency: By leveraging GPU acceleration through PyTorch, the project achieves faster computation times, making it feasible to handle large-scale datasets and complex models efficiently.
